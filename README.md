## Description <a name = "description"></a>
This project aims to create a platform for people to make informed decisions by creating transparency around every decision that is being taken inside the Polkadot Ecosystem. It inherits the specific views from [Polkaviz Project](https://github.com/thevantageproject/polkaviz) for the Kusama Network and adds more information about every participant in the network.

A project funded and supported by [PolkaDAO](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/announcing-polkadao-fund-your-project-1891e6d895a)
